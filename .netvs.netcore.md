#  .NET Framework v/s .NET Core 
| Components |.NET Framework |  .NET Core | 
| ------------ | ---------- | ------- | 
| Open Source		 |Certain components of the .Net Framework are open source. |  .Net Core is an open source. | 
| Cross-Platform | .NET Framework is compatible with the windows operating system. Although, it was developed to support software and applications on all operating systems. |	Works on the principle of “build once, run anywhere”. It is compatible with various operating systems — Windows, Linux, and Mac OS as it is cross-platform. | 
| Application Models | .Net Framework is used for the development of both desktop and web applications as well as it supports windows forms and WPF applications. |  .Net Core does not support desktop application development and it rather focuses on the web, windows mobile, and windows store. | 
| Installation | .NET Framework is installed as a single package for Windows operating system. | 	.NET Core is packaged and installed independently of the underlying operating system as it is cross-platform. | 
| Support for Micro-Services and REST Services | .Net Framework does not support the development and implementation of microservices but it supports the REST API services. | .Net Core supports the development and implementation of micro-services and the user has to create a REST API for its implementation. |
| Performance and Scalability | 	  .Net Framework is less effective in comparison to .Net Core in terms of performance and scalability of applications. |  .NET Core offers high performance and scalability.
| Compatibility |  .NET Framework is compatible only with the Windows operating system. | 	.NET Core is compatible with various operating systems — Windows, Linux, and Mac OS |
| Android Development |  .NET Framework does not support any framework for mobile application development. | .NET Core is compatible with open-source mobile application platforms, i.e. Xamarin, through the .NET Standard Library. |
| CLI Tools |  	.Net Framework is heavy for Command Line Interface and developers prefer to work on the lightweight Command Line Interface. | .NET Core provides light-weight editors and command-line tools for all supported platforms. |


#  .NET MVC v/s .NET Core
| Components | .NET MVC | .NET Core | 
| ------------ | ---------- | ------- | 
| Open Source		 |ASP.NET MVC isn't open source. |  .Net Core is an open source. | 
| Cross-Platform | The previous version ASP.NET MVC was not cross-platform and worked only on Windows. | It's cross platform, which means you can use it on Windows, Mac or Linux. | 
| Dependency Injection (DI) |  In ASP.NET MVC 5/4 , we use separate DI containers like Unity, AutoFac, StructureMap, etc. We had to build up our project to use DI, its additional effort. |In ASP.NET Core applications, dependency injection is inbuilt, i.e., no setup headache for DI. Just create some services and get ready to use DI. | 
| Web stack and Web APIs | ASP.NET MVC 5 will allow us to choose MVC or Web API or both while creating a web application. It was because the web stack for MVC 5 and Web API are different. | ASP.NET Core 5 now has a single-aligned web stack for MVC and Web API.	 |
