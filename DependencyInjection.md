# Dependency Injection (DI) in MVC
- The Dependency Injection commonly called DI pattern helps to inject the concrete implementation of dependent object and finally achieve a low degree of coupling.
- This frees the class from instantiating dependent object.
- It just uses the service that are injected into it at runtime.
- Dependency Injection is a well-known design pattern to create loosely coupled components.
- We can impliment DI by using Unity Package in Mvc.
- Unity is a dependency injection container that can be used for creating and injecting the dependency object using either constructor, method, or property injections.

### The advantages of using Dependency Injection pattern
- Reduces class coupling
- Increases code reusing
- Improves code maintainability
- Improves application testing
