# What is Entity Framework?
- Entity framework  is the framework ORM (object-relational mapping) that Microsoft makes available as part of the .NET development.
- Its purpose is to abstract the ties to a relational database, in such a way that the developer can relate to the database entity as to a set of objects and then to classes in addition to their properties.
