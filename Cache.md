# Caching In Asp.Net

A cache simply stores the output generated by a page in the memory and this saved output (cache) will serve us (users) in the future.

### ASP.NET provides the following different types of caching:

1)Output Caching
2)Fragment caching
3)Data Caching

### 1) Output Caching

- Output cache stores a copy of the finally rendered HTML pages or part of pages sent to the client. When the next client requests for this page, instead of regenerating the page, a cached copy of the page is sent, thus saving time.
- To cache an entire page's output we need to specify a directive at the top of our page, this directive is the @ OutputCache.

```c#
<%@ OutputCache Duration="15" VaryByParam="None" %>
```
- Duration Attribute : This attributes represents the time in seconds of how long the output cache should be stored in memory. After the defined duration the content stored in the memory will be cleared automatically.
- VarByParam Attribute : This is the most important attributes; you can't afford to miss that in the OutputCache directory statement. It generally defines the query string parameters to vary the cache (in memory).
